# HUMAN-POSE-ESTIMATION
# Bicep Curl Counter Using Mediapipe and OpenCV

## Objective
- Develop a computer vision-based application to count bicep curls in real-time using a webcam.
- Use Mediapipe for pose estimation to detect key body landmarks.
- Implement a counter that increments with each completed bicep curl.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for scripting.
- **OpenCV**: Library for real-time computer vision.
- **Mediapipe**: Framework for building multimodal ML pipelines to detect human poses.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.

## Dependencies
- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`
- `numpy`

## Setup
Install necessary libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
